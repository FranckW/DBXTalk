!Asynchronous queries

OpenDBX, when possible, uses asynchronous queries.

Unfortunately, only some database client libraries support real asynchronous queries and important ones like MySQL and Oracle don¡¯t.

This are the combinations that work:

-MSSQL/All
-PostgreSQL/Linux-
-SQLite/All
-SQLite3/All

PostgreSQL/Windows and Sybase might be possible but aren¡¯t implemented yet.
